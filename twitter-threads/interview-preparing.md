# Interview Preparing

## 1. Polish your resume

Make your life easy and use this template.

This one-pager got me hired at GE, Microsoft, and Google.

Make sure you:

- Give context on all your roles
- Quantify your accomplishments
- Use words in the job description

Make it hard to pass on.

## 2. Research the company

Study their company website and social media channels to understand the latest trends.

- Are they investing in something new?

- Are they acquiring another business?

- What are their values?

- Are they being sued?

---

Download the latest earnings call report. 

This is where the **CEO/CFO talk about** the latest **strategies and investments of the company.**

Also, study the **questions from the analysts**. They will give you an idea of what's "top of mind" for investors.

---

Download the latest annual report and memorize the **key figures such as revenue, profit, assets, and cash flow.**

You will also find the business model, products, and risk management profile of the company.

**Show interest in how the company makes money.**

---

Read about the industry they operate in.

- If it's in tech, read about cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and robotics. 

- If it's in energy, read about the prices of oil, natural gas, and renewable energy (solar, wind, nuclear).

Think broad.
